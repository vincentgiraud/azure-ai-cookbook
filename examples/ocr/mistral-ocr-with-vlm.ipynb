The pattern is formed by two converging trend lines, one ascending (blue) and one descending (blue), creating a triangular shape. The black zigzag line within the triangle represents the price action. The green arrow pointing downward indicates a potential bearish breakout from the symmetrical triangle, suggesting that the price may continue to decline after breaking below the lower trend line.'}}]"
